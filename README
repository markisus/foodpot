This is a project using the ordr.in (food delivery) API and Tornado  

ordr.in gives commission on the orders placed through it.  
We put all the comissions a pot, and the first person to  
make an order when the pot fills gets his order for free.  
The pot fills up realtime.  

Along the way, we found some bugs (and undocumented features)  
in the ordr.in python library, so the library included in this  
project has some changes compared to the official release.
(look in /src/Ordrin)  

We tried to implement a threaded server, but it ended up crashing  
during the demo (so something in the code is buggy / not thread safe.  
oops!)  

run src/main.py
